To enhance the authenticity of the experience, suggest that travelers explore some of the quieter streets of Montmartre and seek out local cafés where they can interact with residents or visit smaller art studios that might not be on the typical tourist path. Encourage them to allow for some wandering to discover hidden gems and meet local artists away from the main tourist spots.'\n",

To refine this recommendation, you might encourage travelers to seek out smaller, lesser-known museums or galleries that focus on contemporary or local artists.

However, it can be relatively popular among tourists as well. To refine it further, you could suggest that travelers explore the quieter side streets and alleys of Le Marais, perhaps recommend specific lesser-known cafes or shops that are favored by locals.
